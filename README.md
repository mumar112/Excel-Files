Personal finance dashboard
- I built a personal finance budget dashboard from scratch using pivot tables to make it dynamic. 
- First, we input transactions either as an expense or income. Then, using pivot tables and conditional formatting, we create databars tracking your budget vs your actual expenses by categories such as transport, groceries, leisure etc.
- Thirdly, we create dynamic charts with pivot tables such as a column chart and a bar chart.
- Lastly, we insert slicers to make the dashboard interactive such that you we change the months you want to see.

Field Evaluation Chart
A Field Valuation chart is frequently utilized to display a range of figures, particularly when the precise value cannot be ascertained. 
The yellow line on our dashboard may represent the present stock price or the average of various valuation methods. This type of chart is
commonly referred to as a "football field chart" in the domain of corporate finance and investment banking valuation.

Area Chart
-The optimal scenario to employ a stacked area chart is when you wish to demonstrate an overall pattern or a comprehensive breakdown. As evidenced by our chart,
it showcases the total revenue of Apple products between 2017 to 2021, along with a clear depiction of the trend section indicating how the products have been
performing over time.
